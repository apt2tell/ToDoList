# To-Do-List
In this project, I implemented the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) methods. I built a simple HTML list of To Do tasks. I added some functionality to make it interactive. The user will also be able to mark task completion by selecting the corresponding checkbox (or undo it by unchecking the checkbox). The updated tasks list is stored in local storage.
